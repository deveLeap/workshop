The goal of this exercise is to set up a fresh K8S cluster on Google's cloud infrastructre,
deploy a simple app to it and expose that app to the internet.

The application is a NodeJS application which can be found here: https://gitlab.com/fatliverfreddy/echo.
A built and ready to go containerized version of this app is available DockerHub under the name `avitaltamirdeveleap/echo`.

Create a new K8S cluster in Google, then write YAML files for an 'echo' deployment and a LoadBalancer service, and apply them to your cluster.
